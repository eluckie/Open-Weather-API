#### Making API Calls with JavaScript

#### By Eliot Gronstal

## Technologies Used

* Javascript
* APIs
* Github
* Wepback
* Babel

## Description

Making API Calls with JavaScript - Made During Week 6 at Epicodus Coding School

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Anyone who wants to clone and use our application can simply create their own local .env file with their own API key. 

Next, let's create a .env file in the root directory of our project where we can store our sensitive variables:

Next, we'll use a webpack plugin called dotenv-webpack to make our environmental variables available inside our application:

Once again, when you push projects to GitHub that require API keys, make sure to include instructions in the README so that other users can clone your project and use their own API keys to see what you've built. That means including all steps for getting a key â€” from the link to sign up for an account to any steps to getting an API key to the name of the API key variables that should be added to the .env file. Including accurate instructions for getting and setting up an API key is a requirement for this section's independent project.

(Rewrite this and edit so you can copy/paste on Friday.)



* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

* Worth noting for non-Mac users: in the package.json "scripts" for lint: line 9's has an extra " ' " surrounding src:... which allows es lint to access files recursively  "lint": "'eslint src/*.js'",

## Known Bugs
